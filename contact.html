              <p>He likes beer, reading, juggling, bowling, golf, baseball, hockey, and football. His favorite reading genres Sci-Fi, fantasy, suspense, and true crime. As a hobby he likes building and fixing computers. He  attended technical college for networking, but taught himself all kinds of computer repair such as OS repair, virus removal, and building desktop from parts.</p>

              <p>Stacey is just an average joe who, like many people, went to college, earned a degree and then ended up with a career in a field completely unrelated to her course of study.  She left college as a certified elementary school teacher with aspirations of teaching the 3rd grade.  However, life, the universe, fate or whatever you may believe in often has plans that can’t be fully understood until your looking in the metaphorical rearview mirror.</p>
              <p>Instead of teaching in her own classroom she ended up fielding phone calls in a call center providing outsourced human resources support.  After realizing that she didn’t really like talking to people she quickly moved on.  One thing led to another, yadda, yadda, yadda and the next thing you know she is working on a project team that deploys new software for its clients.</p>
              <p>If you are still bothering to read this you might be asking yourself what does any of this have to do with Drunken Siblings or an online book club.  Well Stacey is the co-founder of Drunken Siblings, which was formed as an excuse for two siblings (Stacey and Jeromey) to get together, hang out, drink a few beers and share their wit and humor with anyone willing to listen.</p>
              <p>She likes to read books, mostly Sci-Fi, fantasy and mystery/thrillers, however, she has been known to read a romantic drama or two (Nicholas Sparks fans you know who you are).  Although you will probably never hear her admit that publicly. She is the mother of two young children and the wife of an amazingly understanding and patient man who allows her to spend her Friday nights doing this, while he takes care of the kids.</p>
              <p>Her other hobbies include amateur cake decorating and starting but never finishing various craft projects.  She has also been known to swing a golf club and roll a bowling ball but is definitely not a high performing athlete.  To get back to the rearview mirror comment, it turns out she really only likes her own kids, other people’s kids give her the heebie jeebies; she would have been a terrible teacher.</p>

              <p>I have few passions in life. One is my family and another is reading. I will read most anything. Some of my favorites are sci-fi, mysteries and horror, detectives, and distopian apocalyptic stories, cause what is better than a good end of the world tale?</p>
              <p>I am your average 65 year old 'Grammy' who spends her days chillin' with my handsome and smart 14 month old grandson Alex and evenings and weekends with my beautiful and smart granddaughters Sarah 14, Katie 8 and Alex's big sister Abby 4. In my 'spare' time I read when I can and watch NFL football and NBA basketball.</p>
              <p>I learned early on that reading was a ready escape for me from a difficult childhood. I have spent many an afternoon in the company of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, Hercule Poirot and Frodo. I have never started a book I didn't finish (maybe not with relish but finish it I did).</p>
              <p>I was deeply delighted when the kids aprroached me with the idea for an online Book Club and podcast discussion group. I could combine two of my passions into one. Reading and spending time with my adult kids. They are a great bunch with a cousin thrown in for good measure.</p>
              <p>There really is nothing better than knowing that not only did your kids grow into fine, productive, tax paying and law abiding indepentant wonderful people, but they share your love of reading and want to spend time talking books with you. What a blessed life I lead now.</p>
