              <p>He likes beer, reading, juggling, bowling, golf, baseball, hockey, and football. His favorite reading genres Sci-Fi, Fantasy, suspense, and true crime.

              <p>Stacey is just an average joe who, like many people, went to college, earned a degree and then ended up with a career in a field completely unrelated to her course of study.  She left college as a certified elementary school teacher with aspirations of teaching the 3rd grade.  However, life, the universe, fate or whatever you may believe in often has plans that can’t be fully understood until your looking in the metaphorical rearview mirror.</p>
              <p>Instead of teaching in her own classroom she ended up fielding phone calls in a call center providing outsourced human resources support.  After realizing that she didn’t really like talking to people she quickly moved on.  One thing led to another, yadda, yadda, yadda and the next thing you know she is working on a project team that deploys new software for its clients.</p>
              <p>If you are still bothering to read this you might be asking yourself what does any of this have to do with Drunken Siblings or an online book club.  Well Stacey is the co-founder of Drunken Siblings, which was formed as an excuse for two siblings (Stacey and Jeromey) to get together, hang out, drink a few beers and share their wit and humor with anyone willing to listen.</p>
              <p>She likes to read books, mostly Sci-Fi, fantasy and mystery/thrillers, however, she has been known to read a romantic drama or two (Nicholas Sparks fans you know who you are).  Although you will probably never hear her admit that publicly. She is the mother of two young children and the wife of an amazingly understanding and patient man who allows her to spend her Friday nights doing this, while he takes care of the kids.</p>
              <p>Her other hobbies include amateur cake decorating and starting but never finishing various craft projects.  She has also been known to swing a golf club and roll a bowling ball but is definitely not a high performing athlete.  To get back to the rearview mirror comment, it turns out she really only likes her own kids, other people’s kids give her the heebie jeebies; she would have been a terrible teacher.</p>

          <p>When Kate Pierce-Keller’s grandmother gives her a strange blue medallion and speaks of time travel, sixteen-year-old Kate assumes the old woman is delusional. But it all becomes horrifyingly real when a murder in the past destroys the foundation of Kate’s present-day life. Suddenly, that medallion is the only thing protecting Kate from blinking out of existence.
              Kate learns that the 1893 killing is part of something much more sinister, and her genetic ability to time travel makes Kate the only one who can fix the future. Risking everything, she travels back in time to the Chicago World’s Fair to try to prevent the murder and the chain of events that follows.
              Changing the timeline comes with a personal cost—if Kate succeeds, the boy she loves will have no memory of her existence. And regardless of her motives, does Kate have the right to manipulate the fate of the entire world? </p>
